\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a new class, \code{itk::RLEImage},
which uses run-length encoding to reduce the memory needed for storage of label maps.
This class is accompanied by all the iterators
to make it a drop-in replacement for \doxygen{Image}.
By changing the image typedef to \code{itk::RLEImage},
many ITK image processing algorithms build without modification and
with minimal performance overhead.
However, it is not possible if the user code
uses \code{GetBufferPointer()} or otherwise assumes a linear pixel layout.

This class is implemented to reduce the memory use of ITK-SNAP (\url{www.itksnap.org}),
so ITK-SNAP is the base for measuring the quantitative results.

The class, accompanying iterator specializations, automated regression tests, and test data
are all packaged as an ITK remote module \url{https://github.com/KitwareMedical/ITKRLEImage}.

\section{Introduction}

Run-length encoding is used in many image compression applications~\cite{wikiRLE}.
Images with groups of pixels with the same value are best suited for such compression,
and label maps (Fig.~\ref{fig:opportunity}) are one such example.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{wb-crop.png}
\itkcaption[Opportunity]{When there are pixels with the same value
next to each other, it is an opportunity for compression. Left to right:
brainParc (parcellation of a brain),
vb-seg (segmentation of vertebral bodies),
wb-seg (segmentation of a whole-body CT using watersheds algorithm),
wb-crop (its shoulder-to-hips cropped version).}
\label{fig:opportunity}
\end{figure}

Although \doxygen{LabelMap}~\cite{Lehmann2007} is well suited for
computing statistics on a static label map
(label map which will not change during the program execution),
it uses a data structure which is not very suitable for either
slice extraction (slicing) or pixel modification (editing).
We therefore propose the new \code{itk::RLEImage} which addresses
this issue by using a simpler data structure.
That makes it not just more suited for on-the-fly editing,
but also significantly faster for slicing (Tab.~\ref{tab:slicingPerformance}).


\section{Data structure}

$n$-dimensional RLEImage is implemented as $n-1$-dimensional \doxygen{Image} of run-length lines.
A run-length line is implemented as \code{std::vector} of run-length segments.
A run-length segment is a pair consisting of pixel value and its repetition count.
A run-length line runs along the fastest chaning index, i.e. X-axis. C++ code:

\begin{verbatim}
typedef std::pair< CounterType, PixelType > RLSegment;
typedef std::vector< RLSegment > RLLine;
typedef typename itk::Image< RLLine, VImageDimension - 1 > BufferType;
typename BufferType::Pointer m_Buffer;
\end{verbatim}

This data structure is quite simple and very similar to uncompressed image.
Once a pixel at a given index is changed, there is not much searching needed
or complex data structure to maintain like in \doxygen{LabelMap}.
This data structure is very convenient for slice extraction (slicing)
across all axes except the first one: uncompressing a run-length line
is about as fast as copying an already uncompressed row of pixels.

Unlike \doxygen{LabelMap}, all the standard iterators are specialized for \code{itk::RLEImage}:
const/\-writable $\times$ withIndex/\-without explicit index $\times$ plain/\-region/\-scanline.
In addition to this, \doxygen{RegionOfInterestImageFilter} is specialized for
Image$\rightarrow$RLEImage, RLEImage$\rightarrow$Image and RLEImage$\rightarrow$RLEImage cases.
If the RegionOfInterest is set to LargestPossibleRegion, the class effectively
does only conversion between standard \doxygen{Image} and \code{itk::RLEImage}.
If RegionOfInterest is smaller than LargestPossibleRegion,
it really behaves as a classic region of interest filter.
For RLEImage$\rightarrow$RLEImage case, the \doxygen{RegionOfInterestImageFilter}
can behave as a caster for template types for repetition counter and pixel values,
e.g. cast \code{itk::RLEImage<short,short>} into \code{itk::RLEImage<long,char>}.

\section{ITK-SNAP Performance measurements}

ITK-SNAP~\cite{py06nimg} is a software application used to segment structures in 3D medical images.
The authors' vision was to create a tool that would be dedicated to a specific function,
segmentation, and would be easy to use and learn.
ITK-SNAP is free, open-source, and multi-platform.

Since version 3.4, snap uses RLEImage for storing and editing segmentation layer.
The interaction speed was not noticeable degraded,
but memory consumption has significantly reduced (Tab~\ref{tab:memoryConsumption}).

    \caption{Memory consumption before addition of RLEImage (Dense) and after (RLE).
    From the first row (without any image loaded) it is clear that
    program itself takes more memory with version \textbf{3.4} than \textbf{3.2}.
    This is influenced by many number of factors, not just addition of RLE compression.}

\end{table}

Scrolling through slices along different axes causes
extraction of slices from the 3D image, called `slicing'.
Slicing is the most frequently executed operation, and its performance is very important.
To take full advantage of \code{itk::RLEImage},
a slicing filter was specialized for it in ITK-SNAP.
Comparison of slicing speed across the principal axes for different input images
is given in Tab.~\ref{tab:slicingPerformance}.

\end{table}

These results show that slicing across the run-length lines is about
twice slower than through uncompressed image.
However, slicing along run-length lines is faster than the algorithm
ITK-SNAP employed before, and not significantly slower than  `pure ITK' RoI filter.
Additionally, it is a few times faster than slicing through \doxygen{LabelMap}.
